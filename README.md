# 💬 E-commerce chatbot (Gen AI RAG project using LLama3.3 and GROQ)

An intelligent e-commerce assistant that understands customer intent, answers FAQs, and runs live product queries against your store database.  

It uses a semantic router to classify user intent into three distinct flows: a RAG-based FAQ system for policy questions, an LLM-to-SQL engine for real-time product discovery, and a conversational agent for general chitchat.

Built with Llama 3.3 via Groq, Streamlit, ChromaDB, SQLite, and Hugging Face embeddings.

## This chatbot currently supports three intents:
- **faq**: Triggered when users ask questions related to the platform's policies or general information. eg. Is online payment available?
- **sql**: Activated when users request product listings or information based on real-time database queries. eg. Show me all nike shoes below Rs. 3000.
- **chit-chat**: Activated when users just want to converse with the bot. eg. Hii,how are you?

## Architecture

 **Flow Overview**:

1.  **Streamlit UI** captures the user's query via the "lively" chat interface.
2.  **Semantic Router** (using Hugging Face encoder) classifies the intent → `faq`, `sql`, or `chitchat`.
3.  **FAQ Path (RAG):** Retrieves top-k relevant context from ChromaDB → Groq LLM answers strictly from that context.
4.  **SQL Path:** Groq LLM generates a `<SQL>` query → System executes `SELECT` on SQLite → Groq LLM summarizes the tabular results into natural language.
5.  **Chitchat Path:** Groq LLM handles casual conversation and general queries using a "Shopping Assistant" persona with real-time date/time context.
6.  **Response** is streamed back to the UI with a typewriter effect.

### Set-up & Execution

1. Run the following command to install all dependencies. 

    ```bash
    pip install -r app/requirements.txt
    ```

1. Inside app folder, create a .env file with your GROQ credentials as follows:
    ```text
    GROQ_MODEL=<Add the model name, e.g. llama-3.3-70b-versatile>
    GROQ_API_KEY=<Add your groq api key here>
    ```

1. Run the streamlit app by running the following command.

    ```bash
    streamlit run app/main.py
    ```

## ⚙️ How It Works

### 🔹 Semantic Router
Uses the `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` encoder to generate embeddings and dynamically route user queries to one of three intents: **FAQ**, **SQL**, or **Chitchat**.

### 🔹 FAQ Flow (RAG)
* Ingests `faq_data.csv` into a persistent **ChromaDB** vector store.
* Retrieves the top-3 relevant context chunks for a user query.
* Passes the retrieved context to the **Groq LLM** to generate a strict, grounded answer without hallucinations.

### 🔹 SQL Flow (Product Search)
* The LLM interprets natural language (e.g., "Red Nike shoes under 5000") and generates a SQL query tagged with `<SQL>`.
* A Python handler extracts and executes the **SELECT** query against the `db.sqlite` database.
* The raw results are passed back to the LLM to generate a natural language summary for the user.

### 🔹 Chitchat Flow
* Handles casual greetings, fashion advice, and general conversation.
* Injects a system prompt with a "Shopping Assistant" persona.
* Dynamically inserts real-time context (Date & Time) so the bot stays temporally aware.

##  Data & Scraping

- `db.sqlite` → sample product table  
  Columns: `product_link`, `title`, `brand`, `price`, `discount`, `avg_rating`, `total_ratings`  
- `web-scrapping/` → optional scripts or notebooks for collecting product data

---

## Tech Stack

- LLM: Llama 3.3 via Groq API  
- UI: Streamlit  
- Routing: semantic-router + Hugging Face encoder  
- Vector DB: ChromaDB  
- SQL DB: SQLite  
- Language: Python 3.10+

---

## Safety & Constraints

- Guardrail: only **SELECT** statements are executed against the database  
- FAQ answers are limited to retrieved context; if unknown → “I don’t know”

---

## Roadmap

- Add order status and returns intents  
- Introduce user sessions / chat memory  
- Migrate SQLite → PostgreSQL  
- Add evaluation harness for LLM→SQL accuracy  
- Integrate vector product search (ChromaDB)  
- Deploy demo (Streamlit Cloud)
<!-- - Dockerfile + GitHub Actions CI/CD   -->
